Tree-based machine learning models (Random Forests and Gradient Boosting) were used with hyperparameter tuning.
Made a forecast of capacity utilization of US manufacturing firms by training and testing a time series data from 2001 to 2024. The results were compared with the traditional ARIMA model. 
Machine learning models outperformed the ARIMA model. 
Out of ML models, Gradient Boosting Machine outperformed the Random Forests Model. 
Most important predictors were identified from a set of internal firm-level variables and a set of external risk indicators
